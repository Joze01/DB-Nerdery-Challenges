## ü§ì Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## üìö Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:15.2
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```

3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

5. Close the database connection:
```
\q
```

4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## üìä Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL queries to achieve the following results (You need to write the query in the section `Your query here` on each question):

1. Total money of all the accounts group by types.

```
SELECT type, SUM(mount) AS total_money
FROM accounts
GROUP BY type;
```


2. How many users with at least 2 `CURRENT_ACCOUNT`.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS users_with_2_current_accounts
FROM (
    SELECT user_id
    FROM accounts
    WHERE type = 'CURRENT_ACCOUNT'
    GROUP BY user_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
) AS subquery;
```


3. List the top five accounts with more money.

```
SELECT *
FROM accounts
ORDER BY mount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```


4. Get the three users with the most money after making movements.

```
SELECT u.id,
       u.name,
       u.email,
       SUM(Case
               WHEN m.type = 'IN' THEN m.mount
               WHEN m.type = 'OUT' THEN -m.mount
               WHEN m.type = 'OTHER' THEN -m.mount
               else
                   COALESCE(CASE WHEN m.account_to = a.id THEN m.mount ELSE 0 END, 0) -
                   COALESCE(CASE WHEN m.account_from = a.id THEN m.mount ELSE 0 END, 0)
           END
       ) AS total_balance
FROM users u
         JOIN accounts a ON u.id = a.user_id
         LEFT JOIN movements m ON a.id = m.account_from OR a.id = m.account_to
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY total_balance DESC
LIMIT 3;
```


5. In this part you need to create a transaction with the following steps:

    a. First, get the ammount for the account `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` and `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590` after all their movements.
    b. Add a new movement with the information:
        from: `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` make a transfer to `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590`
        mount: 50.75

    c. Add a new movement with the information:
        from: `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` 
        type: OUT
        mount: 731823.56

        * Note: if the account does not have enough money you need to reject this insert and make a rollback for the entire transaction
     ```
     DO $$
    DECLARE

        SELECT  SUM(Case

     ```

    
    d. Put your answer here if the transaction fails(YES/NO):
    ```
        YES, it fails
    ```

    e. How much money the account `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590` have:
